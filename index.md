**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain is finding out the connectivity between brain regions over time under resting state, which represents the most natural status of an individual when they are doing nothing and just zoning out. I think this is intersting because we can dive into specific brain regions and understand their default activities over time.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation our group would like to pursue is predicting whether a left or right arm has been moved, or a arm or leg has been moved based on brain activities gathered from MRI scans. The reason we would like to change from resting-state data to task data is because we would incorporate more statistical methods (which are what we are good at) such as hypothesis testing given that we are predicting something instead of a simple exploration on brain connectivity. Since the domain requires a strong neuroscience/medical background, we would like to combine domain knowledge with more knowledge/tools that we're already familiar to make the project more feasible to be done in 1-2 quarter duration. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change that our group would make is focusing more on grouped areas of regions in addition to each smaller specific regions because we can choose from 15 to 300 number of regions to dive into, but we have never group them into e.g. lobes, to see if there's a significant connectivity.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in exploring machine learning techniques because we haven't able to use them this quarter yet, such as SVM, random forests, or neural networks to classify connectivity patterns. I also would like to experiment with dimensionality reduction techniques to better visualize the brain activity data and understand the underlying patterns. Another approach would be using time-series analysis methods to examine temporal changes in brain connectivity, such as dynamic functional connectivity analysis. That way we can understand the brain data but also leverage tools that align with both our domain knowledge and statistical expertise.
